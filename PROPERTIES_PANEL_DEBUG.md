# Properties Panel Debug - Found the Issue!

## üîç **Analysis of Console Logs:**

### **The Good News:**
1. ‚úÖ **Selection is working** - `activeIds: ["qkqWwDIFVZFPle7g"]` shows the item is selected
2. ‚úÖ **StateManager is updating** - `StateManager state changed` logs show it's receiving events
3. ‚úÖ **Zustand store is syncing** - `Zustand store updated` logs show synchronization is working

### **The Problem Identified:**
The issue is in the **RightDrawer component**! Look at these logs:

```
RightDrawer: getDrawerContent called with trackItem: null
RightDrawer: trackItem type: undefined
```

Even though the item is selected (`activeIds: ["qkqWwDIFVZFPle7g"]`), the `RightDrawer` is receiving `trackItem: null` when trying to get the content.

### **Root Cause:**
The `RightDrawer` is reading from the Zustand store, but there's a timing issue where:
1. `activeIds` gets updated first
2. `trackItemsMap` gets updated later  
3. When `RightDrawer` tries to get the trackItem, it's not in the map yet

## **Debugging Added:**

### **Enhanced RightDrawer Logging:**
```typescript
console.log('RightDrawer: trackItemsMap contents:', trackItemsMap);
console.log('RightDrawer: Looking for item with id:', id);
console.log('RightDrawer: Available keys in trackItemsMap:', Object.keys(trackItemsMap));
console.log('RightDrawer: Looking for key:', id, 'Found:', id in trackItemsMap);
```

## **What to Test Next:**

### **1. Try Selecting an Item Again**
When you click on an item in the canvas or timeline, check the console for the new detailed logs:

#### **Expected Logs:**
```
RightDrawer: trackItemsMap contents: { "qkqWwDIFVZFPle7g": { ... } }
RightDrawer: Looking for item with id: qkqWwDIFVZFPle7g
RightDrawer: Selected item: { id: "qkqWwDIFVZFPle7g", type: "video", ... }
RightDrawer: Opening drawer for item: video
```

#### **If Item Not Found:**
```
RightDrawer: Item not found in trackItemsMap
RightDrawer: Available keys in trackItemsMap: ["qkqWwDIFVZFPle7g"]
RightDrawer: Looking for key: qkqWwDIFVZFPle7g Found: true
```

This would indicate a timing issue where the key exists but the value is undefined.

### **2. Check for Timing Issues**
The logs will show us if:
- The `trackItemsMap` is empty when `activeIds` changes
- The item exists in the map but the lookup fails
- There's a race condition between state updates

## **Possible Solutions:**

### **1. If Timing Issue:**
Add a delay or retry mechanism in the `RightDrawer` to wait for the `trackItemsMap` to be updated.

### **2. If Lookup Issue:**
Fix the key lookup logic in the `RightDrawer` component.

### **3. If State Sync Issue:**
Ensure the `trackItemsMap` is properly synchronized between StateManager and Zustand store.

## **Build Status:**
‚úÖ **Build Successful** - Enhanced debugging added

## **Expected Result:**

With the enhanced debugging, we should be able to see exactly why the `trackItem` lookup is failing in the `RightDrawer`. This will help us identify whether the issue is:

- ‚ùå Timing issue (map not updated yet)
- ‚ùå Lookup issue (key exists but value is undefined)  
- ‚ùå State sync issue (map is empty or corrupted)

**Please try selecting an item again and share the new console logs!** This will show us exactly what's happening with the `trackItemsMap` lookup. üîç
