## If Something Doesn't Work

### Videos/Images Not Adding?
1. Open browser console (F12)
2. Look for errors
3. Check if `useStateManagerEvents` log appears
4. Verify StateManager is initialized

### Drag & Drop Not Working?
1. Make sure you're dragging FROM the gallery panel
2. Drop zone should highlight when hovering
3. Check console for errors

### Properties Not Showing?
1. Click item to SELECT it first
2. Item should highlight in timeline
3. Properties panel on right should update

### Timeline Empty?
1. Check if items are actually added (look in Zustand store)
2. Verify `trackItemsMap` has items
3. Check timeline scroll position

## Console Commands to Debug

Open browser console and run:

```javascript
// Check Zustand store state
window.useStore?.getState()

// Check if StateManager has items
// (requires exposing stateManager to window for debugging)
```
