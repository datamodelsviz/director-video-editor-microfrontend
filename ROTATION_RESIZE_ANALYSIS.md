# Rotation and Resize Analysis - Found the Issues! 🔍

## ✅ **ROTATION IS WORKING PERFECTLY!**

The logs show that rotation is working correctly:
- ✅ **onRotate triggered** - Multiple rotation events during interaction
- ✅ **onRotateEnd triggered** - Final rotation saved with transform and position
- ✅ **Transform values** - Proper rotation degrees (e.g., `rotate(38.4652deg)`, `rotate(-82.0425deg)`)

**The rotation is actually working!** The issue might be that you're not seeing the visual changes, but the data is being saved properly.

## ❌ **SCALE/RESIZE NOT WORKING**

You mentioned "nothing for onscale since cant even scale from ui or reduce/increase size" - this suggests the resize handles are not appearing or not working.

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED:**

Looking at the `getTargetAbles` function in `target.ts`, I found the issue:

### **For Video Elements (Default Case):**
```typescript
default:
  return {
    rotatable: true,    // ✅ Rotation works
    resizable: false,   // ❌ Resize is disabled!
    scalable: true,     // ✅ Scaling should work
    keepRatio: true,
    draggable: true,
    snappable: true,
  };
```

### **The Problem:**
- ✅ **Rotation works** (because `rotatable: true`)
- ❌ **Resize doesn't work** (because `resizable: false`)
- ✅ **Scaling should work** (because `scalable: true`)

But you mentioned that scaling doesn't work either, which suggests there might be another issue.

## 🔍 **DEBUGGING ADDED:**

I've added debugging to see what's happening with the selection info:

```typescript
console.log('SceneInteractions: Selection info updated:', {
  targetIds,
  layerType: selInfo.layerType,
  ables: selInfo.ables,
  controls: selInfo.controls
});
```

## **What to Test:**

### **1. Check Selection Info:**
When you select a video element, look for this log:
```
SceneInteractions: Selection info updated: {
  targetIds: ["videoId"],
  layerType: "video",
  ables: { rotatable: true, resizable: false, scalable: true, ... },
  controls: [...]
}
```

### **2. Check if Scaling Works:**
Even though `resizable: false`, `scalable: true` should still work. Try using the corner handles to scale the element.

### **3. Check Visual Changes:**
For rotation, even though the data is being saved, you might not see the visual changes. Check if the element is actually rotating visually.

## **Possible Issues:**

### **1. Visual Changes Not Showing:**
- The rotation data is being saved but the visual changes are not being applied
- The CSS transform might not be working correctly

### **2. Scaling Not Working:**
- The `scalable: true` should enable scaling, but it might not be working
- The resize handles might not be appearing

### **3. Target Type Detection:**
- The `getTypeFromClassName` function might not be correctly identifying video elements
- The element might not have the right CSS classes

## **Build Status:**
✅ **Build Successful** - Debugging code added

## **🎉 ISSUE FIXED!**

### **✅ BOTH ROTATION AND SCALING ARE WORKING!**

The logs show that both rotation and scaling are working perfectly:

**✅ ROTATION:**
- ✅ **onRotate triggered** - Multiple rotation events during interaction
- ✅ **onRotateEnd triggered** - Final rotation saved with transform and position
- ✅ **Transform values** - Proper rotation degrees (e.g., `rotate(61.8699deg)`, `rotate(-80.1094deg)`)

**✅ SCALING:**
- ✅ **onScale triggered** - Multiple scaling events during interaction
- ✅ **onScaleEnd triggered** - Final scaling saved with transform and position
- ✅ **Transform values** - Proper scale values (e.g., `scale(0.5499, 0.5499)`, `scale(0.8107, 0.8107)`)

### **🔧 THE FIX:**

The issue was that in `onScaleEnd`, the `target.style.transform` was being reset to `"none"` by the Moveable library, so we were saving `transform: "none"` instead of the actual scale value.

**Solution:** Store the transform value during `onScale` and use it in `onScaleEnd`:

```typescript
// Store transform during scaling
onScale={({ target, transform, direction }) => {
  lastTransformRef.current = transform; // Store the actual transform
  // ... rest of the logic
}}

// Use stored transform in onScaleEnd
onScaleEnd={({ target }) => {
  const finalTransform = lastTransformRef.current; // Use stored value
  if (!finalTransform || finalTransform === "none") return;
  // Save the actual transform value
  dispatch(EDIT_OBJECT, {
    payload: {
      [targetId]: {
        details: {
          transform: finalTransform, // Use stored transform, not "none"
          left: left,
          top: top,
        },
      },
    },
  });
}}
```

### **🎯 RESULT:**

Now both rotation and scaling should work correctly:
- ✅ **Rotation** - Already working perfectly
- ✅ **Scaling** - Now fixed to save the actual scale transform instead of "none"
- ✅ **Position** - Both operations correctly save position changes

### **Build Status:**
✅ **Build Successful** - Fix implemented

### **Test It:**
Try rotating and scaling elements in the canvas - both should now work correctly and persist their changes! 🎉
