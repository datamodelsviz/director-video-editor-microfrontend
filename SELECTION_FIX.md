# Selection Fix - Items Stay Selected!

## ✅ **Critical Issue Fixed!**

### **The Problem:**
When clicking on timeline or canvas items:
- Item gets selected for a split second ✅
- Then immediately loses focus ❌
- Selection is cleared
- Properties panel can't display anything

### **Root Cause:**
The "Sync frame changes to StateManager" effect was **clearing the selection** every time it ran:

```typescript
// BEFORE (BROKEN):
const newState = frameToStateManagerData(frame);
// ❌ newState.activeIds = [] (empty from frame data)

stateManagerRef.current.updateState(newState);
setState(newState);
// ❌ This clears the selection!
```

### **The Fix:**

#### **1. Preserve activeIds During Sync**
```typescript
// AFTER (FIXED):
const currentState = stateManagerRef.current.getState();
const newState = frameToStateManagerData(frame);

// Preserve activeIds to prevent clearing selection
if (currentState.activeIds && currentState.activeIds.length > 0) {
  newState.activeIds = currentState.activeIds;
}
// ✅ Selection is preserved!

stateManagerRef.current.updateState(newState);
setState(newState);
```

#### **2. Prevent Unnecessary Frame Updates**
```typescript
// Only update if there are meaningful changes (not just activeIds changes)
if (Object.keys(updates).length > 0) {
  onFrameUpdate(frame.id, updates);
}
```

## **How It Works Now:**

### **Selection Flow:**
```
User clicks timeline/canvas item
         ↓
StateManager updates activeIds = ["itemId"]
         ↓
Frame sync effect runs
         ↓
✅ Preserves activeIds (doesn't clear it)
         ↓
Selection stays active
         ↓
Properties panel displays correctly
```

### **Before vs After:**

#### **Before (Broken):**
```
Click item → Selected ✅
Frame sync → activeIds cleared ❌
Result: Item loses focus immediately
```

#### **After (Fixed):**
```
Click item → Selected ✅
Frame sync → activeIds preserved ✅
Result: Item stays selected
```

## **Expected Results:**

### **Timeline Selection:**
- ✅ **Click item** → Stays selected
- ✅ **Selection persists** (no flickering)
- ✅ **Properties panel** opens and stays open
- ✅ **Can edit properties** without losing selection

### **Canvas Selection:**
- ✅ **Click item** → Stays selected
- ✅ **Selection persists** (no flickering)
- ✅ **Can move items** without losing selection
- ✅ **Properties panel** opens and stays open

### **Property Editing:**
- ✅ **All properties** are accessible
- ✅ **Changes apply** in real-time
- ✅ **Selection stays active** while editing
- ✅ **No flickering** or losing focus

## **Build Status:**
✅ **Build Successful** - All TypeScript errors resolved
✅ **Critical Fix** - Selection now works properly

## **Key Changes:**

1. **Preserve activeIds** when syncing frame changes to StateManager
2. **Prevent unnecessary updates** that could trigger re-renders
3. **Maintain selection state** across sync operations

## **Result:**

The selection should now work exactly like the original editor:

- ✅ **Items stay selected** when clicked
- ✅ **No flickering** or losing focus
- ✅ **Properties panel** works correctly
- ✅ **Can move and edit items** without issues

This was the missing piece! The selection was being cleared by the frame sync effect, which was resetting the activeIds to an empty array. Now we preserve the selection during sync operations. 🎉
