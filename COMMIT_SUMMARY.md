# Commit Summary - rc9-spatial Branch ✅

## 📦 **Commit Details:**

**Branch:** `rc9-spatial`  
**Commit Hash:** `635ab823`  
**Status:** ✅ Pushed to remote repository

## 🎯 **Major Features Implemented:**

### **1. Complete Single-Frame Editor Integration**
- Integrated original editor components (Scene, Timeline, RightDrawer) into single-frame focus mode
- Full media support (video, image, audio, text) with drag-and-drop functionality
- Complete canvas interactions (move, rotate, resize, scale)
- Properties panel with full text property persistence

### **2. Layout Improvements**
- Removed left panel in single-frame mode for cleaner interface
- Moved Inspector to left with Frame and Layers tabs
- Properties panel (RightDrawer) opens on right when element selected
- Enhanced Inspector with drag-and-drop frame reordering in multi-frame mode

### **3. Canvas Interactions - Fully Working**
- ✅ Video, image, and text elements support full transformations
- ✅ Rotation persists correctly (no more reverting to original position)
- ✅ Resize handles appear and work properly for all element types
- ✅ Scaling works smoothly with proper transform storage
- ✅ Position, rotation, and scale changes persist across re-renders

### **4. Text Improvements**
- ✅ Increased default font size from 16px to 120px for readability
- ✅ All text properties (fontSize, fontFamily, color, etc.) now persist
- ✅ Properties panel changes apply immediately and don't revert
- ✅ Bidirectional sync between Frame and StateManager preserves all properties

## 🔧 **Technical Fixes:**

### **Data Structure & Sync**
- Fixed data structure mismatch (position stored as `left/top` instead of `position.x/y`)
- Added transform property preservation in state conversions
- Improved StateManager and Zustand store synchronization
- Fixed bidirectional sync to preserve all properties

### **Canvas Interactions**
- Fixed Moveable component configuration for all element types
- Added specific configurations for video, image, and text in `getTargetAbles`
- Resolved CSS conflicts between `transform` and `rotate` properties
- Implemented transform storage using refs to prevent reversion

### **Validation & Error Handling**
- Fixed duration/fps validation to prevent Infinity errors
- Added multi-layer validation in converter, store, and player
- Ensured robust fallbacks for invalid values
